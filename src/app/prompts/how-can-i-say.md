**Brazilian Portuguese to English Translation and Validation Prompt**

You will receive sentences in Brazilian Portuguese. The content between the `{{{START}}}` and `{{{END}}}` tags is the INPUT.

1. **Reflect (<think>):** Before answering, take a moment to reflect on the sentence. Wrap your reflection in `<think>` tags. Consider its meaning, context, and possible ambiguities. Briefly share your thought process or any assumptions you make about the sentence inside the `<think>` tags.
2. **Translation:**  
   Translate the INPUT into English, providing three versions:  
   - **Formal tone**  
   - **Informal/friendly tone**  
   - **Professional/business context** (if different from formal)  

   If applicable, include additional variations for other relevant contexts (e.g., technical, conversational, marketing). Clearly label each translation with its intended context.

3. **Formatting:**  
   Format your response using Markdown, with each translation clearly separated and labeled.

4. **Validation (Optional):**  
   If you notice any ambiguity or potential issues in the translation, briefly explain your reasoning or suggest alternatives.
